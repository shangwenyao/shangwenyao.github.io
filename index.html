        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Taiwanese. Took a gap year in 2019 to pursue interests in robotics and autonomous vehicle. <br>
            My projects include embedded system, robotic control, and SLAM.</p>

        <h2>Lead Experience</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Captain, HKU team of ICRA Robomaster AI Challenge; Vancouver, Canada  — 1.2019-PRESENT</strong><br>
            To implement 2 autonomous robots to navigate and conduct decision-making based on bullet supply, health points and enemy position.<br>
            Took charge of sensor fusion, localozation and enemy tracking.<br>
            Experimented with Google Cartographer ROS for SLAM and auto-navigation. <br>
            Experimented with pattern recognition and KCF algorithm in OpenCV to real-time track the enemy.<br>
